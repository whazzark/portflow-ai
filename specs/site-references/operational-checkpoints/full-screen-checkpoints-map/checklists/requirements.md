# Specification Quality Checklist: Full-screen Checkpoints map

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Q1 resolved 2026-10-22: the V2 "Discharges" section is deferred to a follow-up issue.
- One clarification marker remains, a scope decision for the human spec review:
  - Q2 (User Story 7 / FR-030): keep and restyle bulk archive/reactivate, absent from the V2
    artboards, or remove it?
- "URL", "API" and "basemap" are named only as observable product concepts (shareable state,
  server-side enforcement, map background), not as implementation choices.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
